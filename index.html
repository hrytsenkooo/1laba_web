                The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as 
                the English Bulldog or British Bulldog. It is a medium-sized, muscular dog of 
                around 40–55 lb (18–25 kg). They have large heads with thick folds of skin 
                around the face and shoulders, and a relatively flat face with a protruding 
                lower jaw. The breed has significant health issues as a consequence of breeding 
                for its distinctive appearance

                The German Shepherd, also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a 
                German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed
                was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional 
                German herding dogs from 1899. It was originally bred as a herding 
                dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types 
                of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work,
                and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to 
                the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number 
                of annual registrations in 2013.

                The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. 
                It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden 
                coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered 
                breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows 
                and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a 
                guide dog. The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate 
                Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with 
                Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter.
